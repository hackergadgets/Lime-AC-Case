## Step 2: Soldering the fan header pins.
**You can skip this step if you don't want the active cooling function.**

Soldering the fan header pin for v1.2 on to the J10 connector on the board, if your board is v1.1 use the [1 Row Right Angle Pin (Male) Headers](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Molex/22-28-6100?qs=sGAEpiMZZMs%252BGHln7q6pmxD%2F5kNJnZVeZUjU%2FPShYi4%3D) instead.

**After soldered use a multi-meter to make sure the two pins are not short. Then combine the board with the bottom case to check if the pins are touching the bottom case or not. If touching the case, cut off the excess or resolder.**
